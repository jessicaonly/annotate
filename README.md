annotate.js
===========

JavaScript library to highlight portions of a web page and annotate them with comments.

Todo
----


* ~~Disable/hide start button when active~~
* ~~Disable/hide commit/cancel buttons when not active~~
* Add event hooks so things like the above can be done outside the library
* Use constants/settings for alle class-names, ids, etc.
* Number boxes (top left?). And increase currentId on annotation finished, not on annotation start.
