annotate.js
===========

JavaScript library to highlight portions of a web page and annotate them with comments.

Todo
----

* Use constants/settings for alle class-names, ids, etc.
* Number boxes (top left?). And increase currentId on annotation finished, not on annotation start.
* Improved edit capabilities after boxes are created:
 * Make boxes draggable
 * Make boxes resizeable
 * Option to edit text
